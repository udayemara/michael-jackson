      Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American
      singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop",
      he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th
      century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and
      fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure
      in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres.
      Through stage and video performances, he popularized street dance moves
      such as the moonwalk, which he named, and the robot. He was the eighth
      child of the Jackson family, and made his public debut in 1964 with his
      older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the
      Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). The Jackson 5 signed with Motown
      in 1968 and achieved worldwide success with Michael as lead singer.
      Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown and recorded
      multiple successful singles. He became a global solo star with his 1979
      album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It",
      "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited
      with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form
      and promotional tool. He helped popularize MTV and continued to innovate
      with videos for his albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past,
      Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller is the
      best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce
      five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 1] From the late 1980s,
      Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing
      appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was
      accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was
      settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of
      evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual
      abuse allegations and several other charges. The Federal Bureau of
      Investigation found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson. In 2009,
      while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It,
      Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal
      physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary
      manslaughter for his involvement in Jackson's death. His death triggered
      reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of internet
      traffic and a spike in sales of his music. Jackson's televised memorial
      service, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have
      been viewed by more than 2.5 billion people. Jackson is one of the
      best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 500
      million records worldwide.[nb 2] He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one
      singles (fourth highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the
      first artist to have a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 in five
      different decades. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, a
      Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the "Most
      Successful Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the Rock
      and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the
      Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (making him the only
      recording artist to be inducted) and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of
      Fame.
